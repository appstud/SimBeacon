# SimBeacons

Simple iOS app to simulate an iBeacon device.

Mainly code from Apple's tutorial [Turning an iOS Device into an iBeacon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/turning_an_ios_device_into_an_ibeacon), with added UITextFields for customizing the UUID, major, minor and beaconID values.

Settings are persisted into the UserDefaults.
